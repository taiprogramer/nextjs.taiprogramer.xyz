## Developing

This project has only `main` branch, and this is the branch that all pull requests should be made
against.

To develop locally:

1. Fork this repository to your own GitHub account and then clone it to your local device.
2. Install yarn package manager
3. Install the dependencies with:

```
yarn
```

4. Start developing and watch for code changes:

```
yarn dev
```

We use [prettier](https://prettier.io/) for code formatting. Make sure you have it installed.

And before making a pull request, run `yarn lint` to scan your code to find issues that can lead
to bugs or inconsistencies with code health and style.
